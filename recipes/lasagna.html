    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of flat pasta sheets, meat (typically ground beef or pork), cheese (like ricotta or mozzarella), tomato sauce, and various seasonings. The ingredients are assembled in layers and then baked until the flavors meld together. There are many variations, including vegetarian versions with vegetables like spinach or mushrooms. It's a hearty, comforting meal, often enjoyed for family gatherings or special occasions.</p>
