    <p class="p3">Sambusa is a popular snack in many parts of the world, including the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa. It consists of a thin pastry shell filled with a savory mixture, such as spiced ground meat, lentils, or vegetables. The filling is typically seasoned with a blend of herbs and spices, giving it a flavorful and aromatic taste. Sambusas are often deep-fried until crispy and golden brown, making them a delicious and satisfying treat.</p>
